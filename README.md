My first React project, creating a Weather website as part of the SheCodes React workshop.

### Project Purpose and Goal

The goal of this project was to create my first React application, utilizing my newly acquired knowledge of React. The objective was to build a functional weather website that fetches and displays weather data from an API.

### Web Stack and Explanation

This project focused on learning and using React. The web stack was predetermined to reinforce my understanding and skills in using this JavaScript library.

### Problems and Thought Process

As this was a learning workshop, the primary focus was on understanding and applying React concepts. The main challenge was ensuring that I grasped the fundamentals of React, including component creation, state management, and API integration. Ensuring a solid foundation in these areas was crucial for my future projects.

### Lessons Learned

This project answered many questions about how complex websites are created and where they source their data. It built on my existing knowledge and satisfied my curiosity about web development. The hands-on experience with React provided a strong base for more advanced projects.
